Who doesn't love philosophical quotes that make you question your existence? 

What challenges did i face? 
  - Not remembering to call the main function at the end of my code (this spanned 10-15 minutes of figuring this "bug"/ user error). 
  - Whether or not I could take the input as a str (string) and use the output for my if statements,but since '123' IS indeed 123 to python, I'm going to assume something happened with the comparison operators of my function.
  - I used a less than 1 (if blah_blah < 1) , less than 3 (if blah_blah < 3) , less than 5 (if blah_blah < 5) approach rather than making a conditional if statement for each input value from 1 - 10 (e.g.,if blah_blah == 1:).
  - Maybe in the future i'll implement the above, but this would've meant 10 different philosophical quptes, and I was questioning my own existsence by the second qoute.

## Next Idea
- Recreate and implement in Java, or do a simple caclulator using whatever python's version of switch statements is (or if they have switch statements, then implement that)
